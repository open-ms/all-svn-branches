  This affected some classes in KERNEL and nearly all classes in ANALYSIS/MAPMATCHING.
  The affected classes are not listed in detail here.

- Improved interface of SpectrumCanvas and derived classes for easier reuse outside of TOPPView

- Added support for arbitrary modifications to peptide/protein modifications
- Exceptions thrown by member functions are no longer declared in the header files.
  They are however documented in the class documentation.
