  <h1>Installation Instructions (without the contrib package)</h1>


  <a name="netcdf" id="netcdf"></a>
  <h3>NetCDF (if you do not use the contrib package)</h3>
  NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for
  array-oriented data access and a library that provides an
  implementation of the interface. The NetCDF library also defines
  a machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
  Together, the interface, library, and format support the
  creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.
  <br>
  The NetCDF versions 3.5.1 and 3.6.0 have been tested and used
  with OpenMS. You can get the sources at <a href=
  "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/faq.html#howtoget"
        target=
        "blank">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/faq.html#howtoget</a>.
  <br>
  Installation instructions can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/INSTALL.html"
        target=
        "blank">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/INSTALL.html</a>.

  <p>Since OpenMS has no need for the fortran interface to NetCDF,
  it is probably best to disable it (unless you need it for some
  other reasons) by setting the environment variables FC and F90 to
  the empty string. The following environment has been applied
  successfully:</p>

  <pre>
export CFLAGS="-O"
export CXXFLAGS="-O"
export CPPFLAGS="-DNDEBUG"
export FC=""
export F90=""
</pre>

	<a name="andims" id="andims"></a>
  <h3>ANDI/MS (if you do not use the contrib package)</h3>
  ANDI is a NetCDF based analytical instrument data interchange
  standard. This data standard primarily supports mass spectrometry
  and chromatography.
  <br>
  The version AIA_MS10 has been tested and used with OpenMS. You
  can get the source at <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/andi"
        target="blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/andi</a>.

  <p>Due to its age, ANDIMS does not support comfortable install
  mechanisms.</p>


  <p>Download the file AIA_MS10.zip from sourceforge and unzip it
  to a directory of your choice. Next, unzip the file in
  andims/disk1/ANDI_1.ZIP. Now go into the SRC/ directory.</p>


  <p>You have to edit the Makefile. Please note that if your
  version of unzip creates all-uppercase filenames, you should
  convert them manually to all-lowercase filenames, e.g. the
  directory SRC should contain the file ms10aux.c, not
  MS10AUX.C.</p>


  <p>In the Makefile, you will have to edit the variable OS to
  match your operating system, and you will have to include the
  line</p>

  <pre>
NETCDF = path/to/your/netcdf/installation
</pre>such that in $(NETCDF)/include you will find the file
netcdf.h.

  <p>Afterwards, you should edit the dependencies that are
  specified in the end of the Makefile. Remove any dependency that
  doesn't seem to work on your system, like e.g. all occurrences of
  a nsi_compat.h Now, you can run</p>

  <pre>
&gt; make
</pre>to compile the library. 


  <a name="gsl" id="gsl"></a>
  <h3>GSL (if you do not use the contrib package)</h3>
  The GNU scientific library is used by us for all kinds of
  functionalities and calculations. Versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 have
  been tested and used with OpenMS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Download the sources from <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/"
        target="blank">http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  We did not find a good installation documentation, but this
  should do the job:

  <pre>
&gt; ./configure
&gt; make
&gt; make install
</pre>


	<a name="cgal" id="cgal"></a>
  <h3>CGAL (if you do not use the contrib package)</h3>
  The computational geographic algorithms library offers
  functionalities for many kinds of multidimensional search
  problems. The CGAL versions 3.0.1, 3.1.0 and 3.2.0 have been tested and
  used with OpenMS.
  <br>
  <b><font color="red">Note:</font></b> If you want to use gcc 3.4
  as compiler, you must use CGAL 3.1.0 or higher!
  <br>
  <br>
  Get the source code from <a href="http://www.cgal.org/download/"
        target="blank">http://www.cgal.org/download/</a>.
  <br>
  You can find the installation manual as pdf at <a href=
  "http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.2/doc_html/installation_manual/contents.html"
        target=
        "blank">http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.2/doc_html/installation_manual/contents.html</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b><font color="red">Note:</font></b> During the installation of
  CGAL the platform-specific header file 'compiler_config.h' is
  created in a platform-specific directory in
  'include/CGAL/config/'. You need to copy this file into the
  'include/CGAL/' directory. 


	<a name="xerces" id="xerces"></a>
  <h3>XERCES-C (if you do not use the contrib package)</h3>
  XERCES-C library offers functionality for XML parsing. Thus it can not be disabled in OpenMS configure!
  <BR>
  The XERCES-C version 2.70 has been tested and used with OpenMS.
  <br>
  You can find the installation instructions at <a target=_blank href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html</a>.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Installation is pretty straight forward, but you better use the script <i>runConfigure</i> instead of <i>configure</i>
	itself!
  <pre>
&gt; autoconf
&gt; export XERCESCROOT=&lt;path to the xerces-c source directory&gt;
&gt; ./runConfigure -p linux -P &lt;prefix&gt; -x &lt;c++ compiler&gt;
&gt; make
&gt; make install
</pre>  
  

	<a name="libSVM" id="libSVM"></a>
  <h3>libSVM (if you do not use the contrib package)</h3>
  libSVM  is used for machine learning (e.g. retention time prediction).
  <br>
  The XERCES-C version 2.82 has been tested and used with OpenMS.
  <BR>
  You can find more information at <a target=_blank href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/</a>.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Installation is pretty straight forward:
  <pre>
&gt; ${MAKE} CXX=&lt;c++ compiler&gt;
</pre>  
  
  
  <a name="boost" id="boost"></a>
  <h3>Boost (if you do not use the contrib package)</h3>
  Boost is used for serialization, priority queues, smart pointers
  and other things.
  <br>
  The Boost version 1.33.1 has been tested and used with OpenMS.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to install Boost, you need the boost installer bjam in
  your path.
  <br>
  bjam can be downloaded as binary or source code from <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&amp;package_id=72941">
  sourceforge</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  Installation of boost:
  <br>
  Get the source code from <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586"
        target="blank">sourcefore</a> and untar it.
  <br>
  Installation instructions for boost can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html"
        target=
        "blank">http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  When using gcc, the following steps should do the installation:
  <br>

  <pre>
&gt; cd &lt;BOOSTDIR&gt;/libs/serialization/build/
&gt; bjam -sTOOLS=gcc
&gt; cd &lt;BOOSTDIR&gt;/
&gt; bjam -sTOOLS=gcc --prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; install
</pre>&lt;BOOSTDIR&gt; is the base directory of the boost sources.

<H3>Back to the OpenMS installation</H3>
After you have installed all of the above libraries, you can start with the <a href="install.html#openms">installation of OpenMS</a>.
