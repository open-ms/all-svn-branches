## we need the systems profile for the bash
source /etc/profile 

## we need to set the DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH for the TOPP-tools to execute properly
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/lib/:${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/lib/QtCore.framework/Versions/4/:${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/:${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/lib/QtNetwork.framework/Versions/4/:${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/lib/QtOpenGL.framework/Versions/4/:${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/lib/QtSql.framework/Versions/4/:${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/lib/QtXml.framework/Versions/4/:$DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH

## setting of the OpenMS data path to the share directory
