	given (e.g. PeakSpectrum) that is yielding the similarity normalized in the range of [0,1] of such two
	elements, so it can easily converted to the needed distances. @see PeakSpectrumCompareFunctor.

	The spectrum widgets allow spectrum data to be visualized
	in different manners. There are predefined widgets for
	1D, 2D and 3D visualization. For each type of view, at least
	two new classes must be defined:

	- a "canvas" class derived from OpenMS::SpectrumCanvas,
	  used for painting the data.
	- a "widget" class derived from OpenMS::SpectrumWidget,
	  which holds the instance of the canvas class, and some
	  additional widgets, such as OpenMS::AxisWidget. This
	  class is also responsible for holding the data and for
	  providing it to the canvas class instance.
