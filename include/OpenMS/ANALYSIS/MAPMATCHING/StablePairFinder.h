  /**
   @brief This class implements an element pair finding algorithm.

   It offers a method to determine element pairs across two element maps.
   The corresponding features must be aligned, but may have small position deviations.

   To speed up the search for element pairs and consensus elements, the %StablePairFinder
   uses an "m/z sliding window algorithm" for the nearest neighbor search.

   Motivation and definition of the distance measure:

   The similarity value should express our confidence that one element might
   possibly be matched to the other.  Larger quality values are better, the
   maximal similarity is one.  Let \f$\Delta_\textit{RT}\f$ and
   \f$\Delta_\textit{MZ}\f$ be the absolute values of the RT and MZ differences
   in the data.  Then the similarity value is
   TODO update formula in documentation!!
   \f[
   \frac{1}{
   \big( 1 + \Delta_\textit{RT} \cdot \textit{diff\_intercept\_RT} \big)^\textit{diff\_exponent\_RT}
   \cdot
   \big( 1 + \Delta_\textit{MZ} \cdot \textit{diff\_intercept\_MZ} \big)^\textit{diff\_exponent\_MZ}
   }
   \f]

   Choosing <i>diff_exponent</i>: This parameter controls the growth rate of the
   penalty for differences.  It is for example possible to search for pairs
   using the absolute distance in RT (which should not be very susceptible to
   outliers) and the squared distance in MZ (where small difference occur
   frequently, but large differences indicate a mismatch).

   Choosing <i>diff_intercept</i>: Since we are taking the reciprocal value ("1/..."),
   we include an offset to avoid division by zero in case \f$\Delta=0\f$.  To
   set this parameter, ask yourself: How much worse is a difference of 1
   compared to no difference?

   The following image illustrates the influence of these parameters:
   \image html SimplePairFinder.png "Influence of the parameters intercept and exponent"

   Stability criterion:  The similarity of the second nearest neighbor must be
   smaller than the similarity of the nearest neighbor by a certain factor, see
   <i>second_nearest_gap</i>.
