		@brief Version information class.

		The OpenMS release version and revision data can be retrieved as a string
		or as integers.

		Note that the term <i>"version"</i> refers to releases (such as 1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1,
		1.2, ...),  whereas the term <i>"revision"</i> refers to a revision control system
		such as subversion and is mainly of interest for developers.

		The VersionInfo class contains only static methods.

      On released versions of OpenMS (not from SVN), the result is "exported".
      The result can be possibly be "" on some platforms, which means that
      revision info is unavailable.  You should check for both cases in your
      code.

      @internal Finding out what the revision number is requires some tricks at
      compile time: From CONCEPT/Makefile, we invoke the @c svnversion command
      (with working directory OpenMS/) and store its output in a file that is
      included by VersionInfo.C.
