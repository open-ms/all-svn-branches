		@brief A special vertex that allows to merge several inputs.
		
		A special vertex that allows to merge several inputs. Mergers have two modes: The normal,
		round-based merging mode and a "wait & merge all" mode. In round-based mode, a merger
		first takes the first files of each incoming file list and merges them into a list (which
		has as many elements as the merger has incoming edges). All tools this merger has outgoing
		edges to are called with this merged list as input files.
		As soon as they have all been processed, the second files of each incoming list are merged
		and the tools below the merger are called again, and so on.
		If several mergers are nested, mergers further upstream wait until mergers further downstream
		have performed all their merging rounds and then perform their own next merging round.
		
		In "wait & merge all" mode, the merger first waits for all upstream mergers to finish all
		their merging rounds and then merges all collected files from all merging rounds for all
		incoming edges into one single list and calls the next tool with this list of files as input.
