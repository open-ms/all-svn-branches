The TOPP tools are divided into several subgroups:

# In general, file handling is wrapped by FORMAT/ file handlers. Currently wrapped are the following formats:
- ConsensusXML
- FeatureXML
- IdXML
- ParamXML
- PepXML
- TransformationXML
- TraML
- MzData
- MzML
- MzQuantML
- MzXML

File Handling

x  DTAExtractor - Extracts spectra of an MS run file to several files in DTA format. # all in tool
x  FileConverter - Converts between different MS file formats. # all in tool
x  FileFilter - Extracts or manipulates portions of data from peak, feature or consensus feature files. # all in tool
x  FileInfo - Shows basic information about the file, such as data ranges and file type. # all in tool
x  FileMerger - Merges several MS files into one file. # all in tool
x  IDMerger - Merges several protein/peptide identification files into one file. # all in tool
x  IDFileConverter - Converts identification engine file formats. # all in tool
ok SpectraMerger - Merges spectra from an LC/MS map, either by precursor or by RT blocks # done
x  TextExporter - Exports various XML formats to a text file. # all in tool


Signal Processing and Preprocessing

ok  BaselineFilter - Removes the baseline from profile spectra using a top-hat filter. # morphological filter ok
xx  InternalCalibration - Applies an internal calibration. # TODO overloading fxn

x   PrecursorMassCorrector - Correct the precursor entries of tandem MS scans. #mapped the FeatureFinder, rest of the code is in TOPP tool
ok  Resampler - Transforms an LC/MS map into an equally-spaced (in RT and m/z) map.
