1) get python 2.7

2) on windows: you need the 64 bit c++ compiler from visual studio 2008
   this is important, else you get a different clib than python 2.7 is
   built with, and pyopenms will crash on import

1) install setuptools, see:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

2) "easy_install pip"

3) "pip install git://github.com/uweschmitt/autowrap.git"

4) "pip install nose"

5) get numpy:

   a) on debian/ubunut:   "apt-get install python-numpy"
   b) on 64 bit win 7:    get it from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy

6) cmake as usual, but  with parameters "-D PYOPENMS=ON"
   on windows add: "-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" as the standard python27.dll
   is built in release mode.
  
7) build target "pyopenms", eg: make pyopenms on linux

8) on linux: be sure that the libOpenMS.so in /usr/lib is the one
   you built in step 7)
   (openms has no "install" target....)

8) "cd pyOpenMS"

9) "run_nose.py"
