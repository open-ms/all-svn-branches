// This file inlcudes the TOPPView splashscreen in XPM format (splash.C).
// It is produced from the png file in TOPPView_Splashscreen.png
// by running 'make splash'. This requires imagemagick (convert) to 
// be installed and in the path. Since splash.C is contained in the
// repository, rebuilding splash.C is required only for version changes
// or changes to the splashscreen. THe master file for the splashscreen
// is the Photoshop file TOPPView_Splashscreen.psd. The contents of this
// should be saved as PNG, too. Changes should be made to the master, though,
// as this contains the text as editable layers.
