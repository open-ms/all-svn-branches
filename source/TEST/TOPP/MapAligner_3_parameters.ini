A Gap means that one Spectrum can not be aligned directly to another Spectrum in the Map. This happens, when the similarity of both spectra a too low or even not present. Imagen as a insert or delete of the spectrum in the map. The gap is necessary for aligning, if we open a gap there is a possibility that an another spectrum can be correct aligned with a higher score as before without gap. But to open a gap is a negative event and has to be punished a bit, so such only in case  it 's a good choice to open a gap, if the score is bad enough. The Parameter is to giving as a positive number, the implementation convert it to a negative number." advanced="false" />

The idea behind the affine gapcost lies under the assumption, that it is better to get a long distance of connected gaps than to have a structure gap match gap match.  There for the punishment for the extension of a gap has to be lower than the normal gapcost. If the the result of the aligmnet show high compression, it is a good idea to lower the affine gapcost or the normal gapcost." advanced="false" />
